# Fast Api Open ai chat bot with intent classification and Entity extraction


To run this project follow the command below.


```python
./run.sh
```

Further work:
- Improve slot filling by training a custom slot fill.
- evaluate the intent mapping and validate which label is suitable for our use case
- Experiment and log prompts experiments  for the open ai chatbot 
- Run evaluation 
- Improve the redis storage conversation from last to three or more conversations backward
- Set triggers for the intent and slot filling
